## Features

AppDash has two main modes: **Grid Mode** and **Template Mode**

### Grid Mode

With [Grid mode](docs/grid.md), you can quickly generate a table of widgets

### Template Mode

With [Template mode](docs/template.md), you can use our library of existing templates or add your own.

Stack dashboards together:

Or create multiple dashboards at once:
